<p><strong>The humanitarian context in Liberia</strong></p>
<p>Between 30 March 2014, when the first Ebola case was confirmed in Liberia, and 14 January 2016, when the country was declared free of the virus for the third time, 4,809 people died. Countless other people also suffered directly or indirectly from the deadliest Ebola outbreak on record, which also affected Guinea and Sierra Leone, where 2,536 and 3,956 deaths were reported respectively. The real figures will never be known, but might be much higher due to the number of infected people who were never diagnosed and those who died from other illnesses without access to treatment.</p>
<p>The World Health Organisation declared the Ebola epidemic in West Africa a public emergency of international concern in August 2014, and an ad-hoc international coordination and leadership structure, the United Nations Mission for Ebola Emergency Response – the first ever UN emergency health mission – was created (it closed down in July 2015). The US led the international response in Liberia, deploying thousands of soldiers there, and committed almost $2.4 billion to the response in West Africa as a whole – out of $3.62 billion of total humanitarian funding. The exceptional spread of Ebola in West Africa – much larger than all previous epidemics, both in terms of geographical scope, morbidity and mortality – was attributed to a combination of factors. Among the most cited were high population mobility among densely populated cities, dysfunctional national healthcare services, initial reluctance among locals to accept that the outbreak was real, and cultural practices – such as traditional burials – that involved direct contact with those infected.</p>
<p>During the first months of the outbreak, the number of international actors in Liberia was very small; organisations such as Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) made repeated calls for the drastic scale-up of resources. After the summer of 2014, the deployment of US military personnel and international organisations changed the response landscape; funding commitments increased exponentially. The priority was two-fold: to stop transmission of the virus in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea through outbreak control measures, and to prevent the spread of Ebola to neighbouring countries and outside West Africa.</p>
<p>After two relapses since the first Ebola-free declaration, Liberia now faces the challenge of recovering from the damage caused by the epidemic, while keeping a close eye on a virus that may have become endemic to the region.</p>

<p><strong>The humanitarian context in Niger</strong></p>
<p>Niger is a low-income, landlocked Sub-Saharan country, located in the West Sahel region. The Human Development Report 2015 ranks Niger 188th (out of 188 countries), with a Human Development Index of 0.348. Although, during the last three decades, Niger has experienced considerable improvements in life expectancy at birth, expected years, and mean years of schooling, the standard of living (measured by the Gross National Income per capita) is still below the level of 1980. Almost 90% of the population in Niger are multi-dimensionally poor, and 40.8% live below the income poverty line ($1.25 a day). Most of the poor (94%) live in rural areas.</p>
<p>Fertility rates in Niger are among the highest in the world (7.6 children per woman) as well as population growth rate (3.8% annual change), which means the Sahelian country would triple its population by 2050. Niger’s economy relies mainly on agricultural production, and the majority of the population concentrates in the South, where environmental conditions for farming and herding are more favourable. Agriculture employs two thirds of the workforce in Niger, and accounts for more than half of household income nationally and over 60 percent for rural households.</p>
<p>Production levels of rain-fed subsistence crops, the majority of Niger’s agricultural sector, have been negatively affected by rainfall variability. For example, over the last decade, three periods of drought (in 2004, 2009 and 2011) led to significant deficits of agricultural production. Other factors impacting farmers and pastoralists include poor management of natural resources, overgrazing, soil erosion, and insufficient access to markets. In sum, increases in the amount of farmland have not been enough to compensate for population growth rates, affecting food availability.</p>
<p>Niger has experienced regular food crises since the early 1970s. The sequence of food crises intensified during the 2000s, with recurrences in 2005, 2008, 2010 and 2012, severely affecting the lives and livelihoods of millions of people. The Global Hunger Index qualifies the situation in Niger as ‘serious’, although it reports improvements in the proportion of undernourished in the population (9.5% in 2015 compared to 34.9% in 1995). According to the United Nations Strategic Humanitarian Response Plan 2015, between 3 and 4 million people are vulnerable to food insecurity even in ‘good years’. Meanwhile, instability in neighbouring countries led to an influx of refugees (currently there are 37,000 refugees from Mali and 16,000 from Nigeria residing in Niger) and the return of migrant workers from Libya.</p>
<p>According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the European Union is the largest donor of Official Development Assistance (ODA) to Niger, followed by the World Bank, the United States, and France. Of all the bilateral ODA to Niger, humanitarian aid accounts for 27%. In 2015, the US was the largest contributor to the UN Humanitarian Response Plan ($110 million), while the European Commission disbursed $55 million. The World Food Programme received 68% of the total humanitarian funding.</p>

<p><strong>The humanitarian context in the Philippines</strong></p>
<p>The Philippines is a middle-income South East Asian country made up of over 7,000 islands, with the majority of its fast-growing population (98.3 million) living on 11 of them. The country has officially been a democracy since 1986, following the fall of President Marcos, although it experiences fluctuating levels of political stability and variable economic strength – for instance, the economy grew by 7.2% in 2013, but the country is burdened by external public debt stocks of US$38 billion (as of 2014). A forty-year conflict on the southern island of Mindanao between Moro rebels and the Government officially came to an end with a 2012 peace deal, although the radical Islamist Abu Sayyaf group continues intermittent attacks. The country has also experienced a protracted guerrilla campaign by the communist New People’s Army, with limited success in recent peace talks. Due to its location on a typhoon belt and the ‘Ring of Fire’, the Philippines is hit by an average of 20 major storms per year, and is prone to earthquakes and eruptions from the country’s 20 active volcanos.</p>
<p>Typhoon Haiyan – known locally as Yolanda – was the 25th tropical storm in Filipino waters in 2013, making landfall on the eastern Samar Island on 8 November local time. Much of the devastating impact came from a storm surge (tidal wave), caused by the typhoon, that reached heights of 25 feet in some areas, including the city of Tacloban. The Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration noted that, when it made landfall, Typhoon Haiyan had sustained winds of 147mph and gusts of 171mph. It was the deadliest typhoon in the country’s recorded history. Over 14 million people were affected across 46 provinces, more than one million people saw their homes severely damaged or totally destroyed, and 4 million were rendered homeless. Within days of the typhoon’s landfall, the UN Emergency Relief Coordinator formally activated a system-wide Level 3 response – designating it the highest level of humanitarian concern. This led to a large-scale interagency surge that saw over 450 international staff deployed within 3 weeks to the Philippines – a country with long-standing relationships with UN and humanitarian agencies, strong national capacities, and a well developed disaster management system.</p>
<p>According to the official statistics of the Government of the Philippines, the typhoon resulted in over 6,201 deaths with over 1,785 people reported missing. The total funding for the response to the emergency phase was recorded by UN OCHA as US$865 million, including cash, in-kind, bilateral and multilateral aid. US$469 million of this was channeled to the Typhoon Haiyan Strategic Response Plan (November 2013 – October 2014) – constituting 60% of the $776 million requested to fully fund the plan. The top donors to the action plan were private individuals and organisations (US$120m), followed by UN agencies ($91.4m), the UK ($57.6m), Canada ($45.4m) and the US ($42.7m). Diaspora Filipinos around the world (numbering over 10m in total) came together to raise funds and assist through remittances, which in December 2013 totalled $2.2bn – a 9.1% increase over the same month of the previous year, making a significant contribution to the overall aid effort.</p>

<p><strong>The humanitarian context in South Asia</strong></p>
<p>In 2014, Monsoon rains were especially intense in South Asia, killing hundreds of people, displacing millions and damaging houses, livestock and infrastructure in Bangladesh, India, Nepal and Pakistan. In Bangladesh, floods affected 20 districts in the northeast and central regions, including some of the hardest to reach and poorest areas of the country. In India, the state of Jammu and Kashmir suffered the worst floods in 50 years, which also affected six other states, as well as North and East Pakistan. In addition, the Indian state of Odisha was hit by cyclone Hudhud months later, forcing a massive evacuation. In Nepal, while floods and landslides were less destructive than in neighbouring countries, the most affected areas in the mid-West were not prepared for an event of such magnitude. In sum, unexpectedly heavy monsoon rains directly affected 13 million people in India, two and a half million in Pakistan, two million in Northern Bangladesh, and almost 180,000 in West Nepal.</p>
<p>As one of the most disaster-prone regions in the world, South Asia is no stranger to natural hazards. Four out of the ten deadliest natural disasters since 1980 have happened in South Asia, including the Indian Ocean Tsunami, the cyclone that devastated Southeastern Bangladesh in 1991, the 2005 Kashmir earthquake, and the Nepal earthquake in April 2015. In addition to those large-scale disasters, a multiplicity of medium and small natural disasters has hit the region and continues to do so with increasing frequency. South Asia is also home to protracted conflicts in Afghanistan and Pakistan, as well as a high number of low-intensity ones.</p>
<p>Although South Asia has suffered the largest number of fatalities from natural disasters in the Asia-Pacific region – more than 1 million people between 1970 and 2014 – there is a consistent downward trend since the year 2000. Economic losses from natural disasters in South Asia are considerable – 0.37 percent of Gross Domestic Product between 1970 and 2013 – and have remained unchanged during the last decade, with floods accounting for most of the damage to infrastructures, houses and livelihoods.</p>
<p>During the last two decades, national and regional natural disaster management legislation has been passed, and relevant bodies have been set up and approved across South Asia. As a result, states in the region adopted a more visible role in disaster preparedness, early warning, and response. In addition, the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation established the Comprehensive Framework on Disaster Management, the Agreement on Rapid Response to Natural Disasters, and the Disaster Management Centre, following the example of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.</p>
<p>This process is taking place in a region that for decades has been the destination of considerable flows of foreign aid, and is home or destination for a plethora of international and national aid organisations, among them some of the largest and reputed Southern NGOs.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A major theme in humanitarian discourse over the last 25 years, effectiveness has been a central concern for those seeking to reform humanitarian practice and governance. Research on humanitarian effectiveness has taken the concept at face value, exploring what is effective, how to be more effective, and what the impact has been of individual initiatives. With effectiveness at the forefront of strategic discussions within Save the Children and across the humanitarian sector, the Humanitarian Affairs Team (HAT) felt that there are important questions to be asked:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why has effectiveness become an organising ideal for humanitarians?</li>
<li>What is the character of the ‘humanitarian effectiveness agenda’ that has been constructed of initiatives to improve humanitarian performance?</li>
<li>Why is effectiveness understood in the way it is, and what are the implications of all this?</li>

<p><strong>The humanitarian context of the Syrian Arab Republic and the civil war</strong></p>
<p>Constitutionally a semi-presidential republic, Syria is a closed authoritarian regime ruled by President Bashar al-Assad since 2000 and, before that from 1970, his father Hafez al-Assad. Inspired by a series of pro-democracy protests in countries throughout the Middle East from late 2010, known as the ‘Arab Spring’, many Syrians began taking to the streets calling for regime change. In March 2011, non-violent, pro-democracy protests erupted in the southern city of Deraa in response to the arrest and torture of school children for painting revolutionary graffiti. These protests were met with violent repression as government security forces opened fire on demonstrators, catalysing nationwide protests demanding Assad’s resignation, which were in turn violently crushed. The escalating violence rapidly disintegrated into a civil war as rebel brigades formed to battle government forces across the country. By 2013 there were thought to be as many as 1,000 armed opposition groups fighting inside Syria. These groups are diffuse, varied in mission and method. Some are supported financially and militarily by a range of different international powers, including Russia, Iran, Turkey and Saudi Arabia. A few high-profile groups, including Islamic State and the Al-Qaeda-affiliated Jabhat al-Nusra, have adopted terrorism and jihadist insurgency tactics, recruited foreign fighters, and undertaken high-profile attacks and executions. On the diplomatic front, frequent national and international attempts to consolidate a legitimate and strong political opposition, or broker peace have consistently failed.</p>
<p>In January 2013, six months after the conflict was formally declared a civil war, the Syria crisis was confirmed as a level three (the highest ranking) humanitarian emergency, which resulted in the largest ever appeal launched by the United Nations. Mortality rates and numbers of those affected and displaced are extremely difficult to determine and verify, not least due to security and access issues and concerns over the manipulation of statistics. Nevertheless, the current number of people killed in Syria is estimated to be over 250,000, which includes at least 10,000 children. OCHA states that 13.5 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance – 6 million of whom are children and 1.5 million of whom have a disability. Over 4.8 million have fled the country, with the majority pouring into the neighbouring countries of Turkey (2.7m), Lebanon (1.1m) and Jordan (0.64m) – triggering a regional refugee crisis. The number of those internally displaced is estimated at over 6.6m and those designated as ‘hard to reach’ or besieged at 4.5 million. It is also thought that 8.7 million people are unable to meet their daily food needs, that 70% of the population are without safe access to drinking water, and that 5.3 million people are in need of shelter. This is in part owing to the deliberate targeting of civilian infrastructure – which has included attacks on, and military use of, schools, hospitals, economic assets and water networks. There has been a fundamental disregard of human rights by all parties to the conflict, with attacks on civilians – including aerial bombardments and starvation through besiegement – being used as tactics of war.</p>
<p>The UN’s Strategic Response Plan for Syria offers a programmatic framework for addressing the key humanitarian issues arising from the crisis. The plan emphasises multi-sectoral programming focused on the most vulnerable groups, and calls for increased flexibility in humanitarian programming and improved humanitarian access. It also aims to mainstream protection work, focus on emergency response preparedness, and ensure the strategic use of country-based pooled funds. However, a core difficulty in meeting these aims is a chronic funding gap, which is forcing agencies to scale down programming. Funds requested for the Syria Humanitarian Response Plan in 2015 were US$2.9bn, only 43% of which were met. This shortfall was echoed for the Syria Regional Refugee and Resilience Plan, which required $4.3bn and received just $2.8bn. With these severe funding shortfalls and the absence of a viable political solution on the table, the humanitarian outlook for Syria in 2016 remains dire.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The five essays that form the collection <em>Essays on Humanitarian Effectiveness</em> are the result of extensive desk and field research carried out in nine countries: Bangladesh, India, Nepal; Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey; Liberia; Niger; the Philippines. The essays – part of a project by Save The Children’s Humanitarian Affairs Team, in partnership with the <a href="http://www.hcri.manchester.ac.uk/">Humanitarian and Conflict Response Institute</a> at the University of Manchester – analyse understandings of humanitarian effectiveness in different geographical, social and cultural contexts and their influence on how particular responses are shaped and assessed. The field research that resulted in the five essays here also informed the analysis contained in <a href="https://fernandoespada.github.io/2016/05/the-echo-chamber/"><em>The Echo Chamber</em></a>; these essays may be read as a complement to the latter, or as a stand-alone collection, or individually.</p>
<p>The decision of the Humanitarian Affairs Team to start working on humanitarian effectiveness, in July 2014, was partly opportunistic: the issue is part of the daily discussion at Save the Children and in the humanitarian sector as a whole, as the World Humanitarian Summit’s choice of humanitarian effectiveness as one of its key topics demonstrates. But it is not merely a topical issue: the theme of humanitarian effectiveness has been central to humanitarian discourse since, at least, the mid-1990s. In our attempt to go beyond easy answers to a complex question, we decided to partner with the Humanitarian and Conflict Response Institute at the University of Manchester. <a href="https://fernandoespada.github.io/2016/05/essays-on-humanitarian-effectiveness/"><em>Essays on Humanitarian Effectiveness</em></a> and <em>The Echo Chamber</em> are the result of a year and half of intense work.</p>
<p>The first study was carried out between November and December 2014, in Bangladesh, India, and Nepal, following particularly intense floods across the three countries and Pakistan (a planned visit to which had to be cancelled due to security concerns). The second study was conducted in the Philippines, between January and February 2015, to analyse the response to Typhoon Haiyan (locally known as Yolanda), one of the strongest typhoons on record.</p>
<p>In April and May 2015, field research was carried out in Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan, looking to understand the perspectives of humanitarian actors operating inside Syria and across its borders. In May 2015, research was carried out in Niger, addressing the context that humanitarian agencies define as slow-onset shocks, and local people simply see as ‘good’ and ‘bad’ years. The final field study analysed the international and local responses to the Ebola outbreak in Liberia; it was conducted in Monrovia, in May 2015.</p>
<p>The researchers used desk reviews, semi-structured and unstructured interviews with informants in capitals and field locations, focus groups with communities, and observation. Researchers sought to ensure appropriate representation of relevant communities (affected people, humanitarian workers, local officials, etc) and organisations (international, local, UN agencies, Red Cross, NGOs, governments, etc). The purpose of the interviews, focus groups, and the project as a whole was explained in advance to informants, with the guarantee that their contribution would remain anonymous. Although the research was not inductive, researchers were asked to allow space for the field research process to evolve, and to adapt, if necessary, the key themes that would then be addressed in the essays.</p>
<p>It is widely believed that humanitarian action is more effective today than in the past, thanks to the adoption and refinement of management processes, tools and techniques, and the professionalisation of humanitarian workers. Insofar as the humanitarian effectiveness agenda has not achieved success on its own terms, this is seen as evidence of the need for more of the same. However, as <em>The Echo Chamber</em> argues, the urge to identify and replicate ‘what works’ has transformed the humanitarian sector into a closed shop. A particular understanding of effectiveness, within the parameters set by Western actors, has been used without adequate consideration of either their own ideological motivations for such transformations or the demands and aspirations of people in crisis-affected countries. The confidence in management processes and the adoption of apparently neutral technical solutions – ignoring political, economic or social factors – reflects a reluctance among those providing assistance to share power with those on the receiving end. The objectives of humanitarian agencies, according to the criteria of efficiency, productivity and marketability characteristic of neomanagerialism, has become the priority. A self-referentialism has taken root in the humanitarian sector; managementspeak has become a lingua franca for humanitarian workers that deters and delegitimises criticism from those who cannot or refuse to adopt it. Rationality and effectiveness have become the incontrovertible truths that conveniently privilege and protect the intellectual dominance of those agencies that already hold the power. Reform and improvement is encouraged, but also carefully limited to the boundaries of the humanitarian market-place.</p>
<p>In her <a href="https://fernandoespada.github.io/2016/05/the-philippines/">analysis of the response to Typhoon Haiyan in 2014</a>, Jessica Field reflects on the disconnection between the priorities set by humanitarian agencies, which overlooked everyday politics, and those of Filipinos. By reacting to the disaster as an exceptional event, rather than a momentous but ‘everyday’ disaster, and targeting individuals, rather than communities, in accordance with predetermined definitions of need and vulnerability, the agencies delivered assistance that was not culturally appropriate. Rational methods to determine the best responses to identified needs failed to recognise that communities were demanding, for instance, equality in the distribution of assistance.</p>
<p>Such a deficit in understanding of political and social dynamics also hindered the effectiveness of the response to the Monsoon floods in Bangladesh, India and Nepal in 2014, as the essay <a href="https://fernandoespada.github.io/2016/05/south-asia/">‘On Authority and Trust’</a> concludes. Humanitarian agencies and local governments in the region speak radically different languages that widen the trust gap between them. In response to increasing attempts by South Asian governments to exert their authority over the response (relegating civil society organisations to a service provider role), humanitarian agencies react by focusing even more on short-term programmes and technical solutions, which ultimately make them accomplices of the bureaucratic structures that challenge their autonomy.</p>
<p>An exclusive focus on easy-to-deliver programmes that can achieve measurable results proves extremely convenient for donor governments seeking to prevent humanitarian agencies from taking undesirable risks in politically sensitive contexts. As Jessica Field explains in her <a href="https://fernandoespada.github.io/2016/05/syria/">essay about the response to the Syria crisis</a>, complying with counter-terrorist legislation has taken precedence over any humanitarian consideration. Reporting programme activities and results to ensure no accidental link to any terrorist group becomes the priority of international humanitarian agencies and their local partners. Because of the risk aversion of donor governments, humanitarian agencies surrender their autonomy and distance themselves from those who they seek to support.</p>
<p>Distance can transform everyday realities into emergencies, when convenient. <a href="https://fernandoespada.github.io/2016/05/niger/">David Matyas identifies this process in Niger</a>, a country considered to be in permanent ‘state of exception’. Such exceptionality fits the ideal template for humanitarian agencies to appeal for funds, coordinate responses, and manage programmes. As a result, local perspectives of effectiveness that value the ability to stay in place or self-determination (as opposed to dependency) are dismissed.</p>
<p>In the same way, local capacities and priorities were bypassed in the response to the Ebola outbreak in Liberia, on the grounds of the unprecedented nature of the crisis, as <a href="https://fernandoespada.github.io/2016/05/liberia/">the essay on Ebola response in Liberia</a> explains. Ignoring the repeated calls for assistance and then wrongly defining the outbreak as unprecedented, unexpected, and/or unmanageable, requiring a containment operation, excluded local people from ownership of the event and the response, presenting them as passive victims or even vectors in the transmission of the disease. That this limited the humanitarian effectiveness of the response was proven by the fact that, when given information, resources and trust, Liberians were able to control the spread of the virus.</p>
<p>The essays do not follow a common structure, but share a goal: to tell a story about how effectiveness has been constructed, discussed, operationalised, or even imposed. As such, they are not exhaustive accounts of responses, or the activities of humanitarian agencies; they do not necessarily offer the type or sequence of information usually found in NGO reports. The authors were given the liberty to approach each context freely and follow a trail that might offer an original and valuable perspective on humanitarian effectiveness. We believed that that freedom, within the limits of professional integrity and research rigour, was the right approach for this project. We hope readers will agree.</p>
<p>We would like to thank the members of the Steering and Advisory Groups, as well as the dozens of informants who agreed to be interviewed, for their patience and invaluable contribution to this project. The content of this introduction and the six essays does not reflect the opinion of Save the Children UK. Responsibility for the information and views expressed in this publication lies entirely with the authors.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On 23-24 May 2016, Istanbul, Turkey, will host the World Humanitarian Summit. Called by the UN Secretary-General in 2013, the WHS is the latest attempt to build common agreement on the reforms required to improve humanitarian performance. It has involved a lengthy and substantial consultation process – eight regional consultations, 151 country consultations, online consultation, thematic expert consultation, a global consultation, and numerous associated events – which, led and managed by the UN, with the participation of more than 23,000 people, has demonstrated the capacity of the humanitarian sector to mobilise resources to engage in focussed discussions while at the same time imposing limits for substantial change.</p>
<p>The WHS is an ambitious initiative insofar as it is intended to set a ‘<a href="https://docs.unocha.org/sites/dms/CERF/WHS_FAQ_English_15may.pdf">new agenda for humanitarian action</a>’, informed by ‘perspectives, priorities and recommendations of all stakeholders on what must be done to make humanitarian action fit for the future’. But the fact that it is not being convened in response to a resolution of the UN General Assembly or the Economic and Social Council is not a minor detail. Its outcomes will not be binding for member states. In the final months before the summit itself takes place, there has been a growing tension that is reflective of the humanitarian community’s relationship to politics: there has been recognition that member states will need to engage seriously, agreeing to, and taking certain ownership of, the summit outcomes if these are to be of consequence; yet there is fear that serious engagement by member states will push the discussions of civil society organisations (particularly smaller ones) to the margins, turning the summit into a forum for the pursuit of geopolitical objectives over the interests of crisis-affected populations, and inevitably resulting in a watered-down outcome document that balances the concerns of the most powerful states. Sure enough, as the format of the summit in Istanbul has been slowly defined, and as efforts have been made by the humanitarian community to ensure the attendance of influential statespeople, the disconnection between the participatory consultation process and the plan for the summit itself has become increasingly patent, not least on account of the clear division of the summit into separate tiers with limited opportunity for civil society representation in the ‘high-level’ meetings.</p>
<p>Such a large-scale initiative required the creation of an adhoc bureaucracy – the WHS Secretariat – to manage the various consultations and the Istanbul summit. The job description for the Chief of the WHS Secretariat stated that ‘<a href="https://jobs.undp.org/cj_view_job. cfm?cur_job_id=42568">the process leading up to the summit [&#8230;] will be as important as the summit itself</a>’, putting the emphasis on the management dimension of the position. Candidates for the post were required to have at least fifteen years of ‘managerial experience’ in relief coordination in emergency situations, but there was no mention of a need for experience of coordinating or facilitating international consultations and summits. For the UN, an experienced manager would be able to lead what, in the final instance, would be a process of political negotiation – a nod to the centrality of management to contemporary humanitarianism.</p>
<p>The need to come up with ‘the big idea’ has been repeatedly raised in discussions related to the WHS. The notion that the WHS should produce the silver bullet that can do away with the current shortcomings of humanitarian action sits in tension with the proposal that a wellmanaged process is as important as the summit itself; but it is reflective of the linear-rational thinking that is characteristic of ‘humanitarian neomanagerialism’ (an ideology and culture that, as will be explained in this paper, has shaped the humanitarian effectiveness agenda).</p>
<p>As humanitarian agencies search for solutions, or rather ‘the solution’, in a process without a firm political mandate, they inevitably turn inwards to consider the technocratic measures that they can themselves deliver: new mechanisms and tools, bureaucratic processes and structures, technologies and indicators. The understandable demand for tangible and actionable recommendations then serves to leave unchallenged fundamental questions about culture and politics in the humanitarian sector.</p>
<p>How did such a situation come about? The new geopolitics of the 1990s analysed in the introduction of <a href="https://fernandoespada.github.io/2016/05/the-echo-chamber/"><em>The Echo Chamber</em></a> provides an important point of departure for the story.</p>
